I am new to Ruby on Rails and coding in general. Up to this point I have
always tried to work in the cloud. I do not like being tied to one machine,
and I hate the idea that I am responsible for saving files and risk losing
them if a machine goes down. 


For example, When Google Music became available I could not wait for an
invite so that I did not have to store alof my music on my phone and
computer. There are drawbacks to working in the cloud but it all comes down
to three major benefits: **Location, Location, Location**.


Using nitrus.io allows me to use any machine, anywhere. Most importantly, 
and most impressively I am able to use my Chromebook for RoR development. I
prefer this to my PC, mostly because of battery power. Learning in the Linux
environment that nitrous.io seems like a benefit down the road as well.
