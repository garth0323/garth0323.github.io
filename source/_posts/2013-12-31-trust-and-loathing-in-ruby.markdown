Learning Ruby or probably any language is scary. It is exciting but scary. I
had to learn to trust that things are going to work even when I don't
understand why.


- I understand that A + B = C
- But sometimes I don't know how B got it's value so I just test the outcome.
- I sometimes Google issues and don't understand the answer, but I test it and it works out.



This trust in the community allows me to expirement and stretch beyond what I know now.
I am allowed to mess up knowing that the answer is just a Google search away. 
Or maybe 4 hours worth of Google searches away...
