    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Configuring Sinatra and Shotgun on Nitrous.io is a pretty straightforward
process once you have the commands to do so. Finding these was not easy for
me and so I wanted to make it easy for others.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First thing you need to know is that nitrous.io needs to run on host
&lsquo;0.0.0.0&rsquo; in order to work properly. The binding must be changed from
the default of &lsquo;localhost&rsquo; for Sinatra and Shotgun.</p>

<h4>Sinatra</h4>

<p>Sinatra is pretty straightforward just put the following code in your
main.rb file and this allows you to preview on port 3000 which is the
nitrous.io default.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>configure :development do
</span><span class='line'>  set :bind, '0.0.0.0'
</span><span class='line'>  set :port, 3000
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Start your server with this in your console:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ruby main.rb</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Shotgun</h4>

<p>Shotgun is a slightly more annoying but still fairly simple and handled
from the command line. Once shotgun is installed put this in your command
line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>shotgun -o, --host 0.0.0.0</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This wil start the server.</p>

<p>View it by going to any of the previews in Nitrous and then changing the
end of the URL to 9393. This is the default port for shotgun.</p>

<p>There are still some workarounds necessary for developing on Nitrous but the
upside still seems worth it to me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am new to Ruby on Rails and coding in general. Up to this point I have
always tried to work in the cloud. I do not like being tied to one machine,
and I hate the idea that I am responsible for saving files and risk losing
them if a machine goes down.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>For example, When Google Music became available I could not wait for an
invite so that I did not have to store alof my music on my phone and
computer. There are drawbacks to working in the cloud but it all comes down
to three major benefits: <strong>Location, Location, Location</strong>.</p>

<p>Using nitrus.io allows me to use any machine, anywhere. Most importantly,
and most impressively I am able to use my Chromebook for RoR development. I
prefer this to my PC, mostly because of battery power. Learning in the Linux
environment that nitrous.io seems like a benefit down the road as well.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learning Ruby or probably any language is scary. It is exciting but scary. I
had to learn to trust that things are going to work even when I don&rsquo;t
understand why.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>I understand that A + B = C</li>
<li>But sometimes I don&rsquo;t know how B got it&rsquo;s value so I just test the outcome.</li>
<li>I sometimes Google issues and don&rsquo;t understand the answer, but I test it and it works out.</li>
</ul>


<p>This trust in the community allows me to expirement and stretch beyond what I know now.
I am allowed to mess up knowing that the answer is just a Google search away.
Or maybe 4 hours worth of Google searches away&hellip;</p>
